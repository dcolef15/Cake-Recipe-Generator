          Triple Chocolate Cake
          <br />
          Key Chocolate Cake Ingredients: All-Purpose Flour: The structure of
          the cake. Unlike confetti cake where you can use either, do not use
          cake flour here—when combined with ultra-light cocoa powder, cake
          flour is too fine for this cake. Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder: Do
          not use dutch-process cocoa powder. If you’re interested, see
          dutch-process vs natural cocoa powder for an in-depth explanation.
          Baking Soda & Baking Powder: Remember the differences in baking soda
          vs baking powder? We use both here for lift. Salt: Salt balances the
          flavor. Espresso Powder: Espresso powder is optional, but I recommend
          its addition because it enhances the chocolate flavor. The chocolate
          cake will not taste like coffee, I promise. I use espresso powder in
          my chocolate zucchini cake, Guinness cake, chocolate raspberry cake,
          and marble loaf cake too! Oil: Don’t use butter in this cake batter.
          Cocoa powder is a particularly drying ingredient, so this cake needs
          oil for suitable moisture. Eggs: Use 2 room temperature eggs. To speed
          up the gently warming, place refrigerated eggs in a cup of warm water
          for 10 minutes. Did you know what the temperature of your ingredients
          has a direct correlation to the success of your recipes? Unless
          otherwise noted, use room temperature ingredients. Buttermilk: This
          chocolate cake requires the moisture and acidity from buttermilk.
          Lately I’ve been using a mix of sour cream and buttermilk, as well as
          reducing the hot liquid. You can read more about this next and see my
          dark chocolate mousse cake, tuxedo cake, black forest cake, German
          chocolate cake, and chocolate peanut butter cake recipes. Vanilla
          Extract: Vanilla extract adds flavor. Hot Coffee or Hot Water: Hot
          liquid enhances the cocoa powder’s flavor. It also encourages it to
          bloom and dissolve appropriately. You’ll notice I don’t use hot liquid
          in my chocolate cupcakes recipe. That’s because there isn’t the same
          volume of dry ingredients. With this amount of cake batter, we need a
          hot liquid to break up the cocoa powder lumps resting in all that
          flour. If you don’t drink coffee, you can use hot water. For deeper
          and darker flavor, though, use coffee. (Decaf coffee works!)
